# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
## Project: Distinct Multi-Page Personal Portfolio
## Status: Design Phase
## Owner: [Your Name]

# 1. Vision

Create a multi-page personal portfolio that feels authored, intentional, and culturally aware — not templated.

This product must reject “AI slop” aesthetics and startup-template minimalism.  
It should feel like a designed digital space with conviction.

The portfolio must communicate:
- Technical depth
- Creative intelligence
- Professional discipline
- Personal identity
- Confidence without noise

If it looks like a SaaS landing page, it has failed.

---

# 2. Core Design Principles

## 2.1 Anti-Generic Rule
The design must avoid:
- Centered hero + 3-card layout
- Evenly distributed safe color palettes
- Overused font pairings
- Predictable spacing systems
- Symmetrical card grids everywhere
- Dribbble-trend gradients

Every decision must feel deliberate.

---

## 2.2 Typography as Architecture

Typography drives layout — not decoration.

Requirements:
- Distinct headline typeface with personality
- Contrasting secondary body typeface
- Clear hierarchy (Display / H1 / H2 / Body / Caption)
- Strong vertical rhythm
- Intentional letter-spacing
- Generous negative space

Typography must create visual tension and balance.

---

## 2.3 Color Philosophy

- One dominant base tone
- One strong accent
- Optional subtle secondary neutral
- No timid multi-color distribution
- High contrast where necessary
- Cohesive visual identity across pages

Use a disciplined variable system for consistency.

---

## 2.4 Layout System

- Grid-based but not rigid
- Asymmetry allowed with control
- Intentional whitespace
- Section contrast (background shifts, spacing shifts)
- Avoid visual monotony between pages

Pages should belong to the same universe — not look cloned.

---

## 2.5 Motion Philosophy

Motion must be purposeful and limited.

Priorities:
- One orchestrated page-load sequence
- Staggered reveals for typography blocks
- Calm transitions between pages
- Subtle hover states

Avoid:
- Bounce animations
- Excessive parallax
- Constant motion noise

Impact > frequency.

# 3. Information Architecture (Multi-Page Structure)

This is not a single scroll website.

---

## 3.1 Home (Statement Page)

Purpose: Establish identity immediately.

Goals:
- Strong typographic opening statement
- Visual dominance within first viewport
- Clear directional navigation
- Controlled atmosphere (background depth)

Content:
- Name
- Positioning statement (not generic)
- One strong primary call-to-action
- One secondary navigation cue

Success Criteria:
User understands tone and personality within 5 seconds.

---

## 3.2 Work (Projects Index)

Purpose: Showcase capability with clarity and character.

Requirements:
- Structured but non-generic layout
- Projects presented in varied composition (not identical cards)
- Strong project titles
- Minimal meta data
- Intentional hover interaction concept

Projects must feel curated — not mass produced.

---

## 3.3 Project Detail Page

Purpose: Deep dive into individual work.

Structure:
- Large project title
- Context / Problem
- Process overview
- Visual highlights
- Key outcomes
- Reflection or takeaway

Design must prioritize readability and narrative clarity.

---

## 3.4 About (Philosophy Page)

Purpose: Show thinking, not resume.

Requirements:
- Editorial layout
- Pull quotes or emphasis blocks
- Structured sections (Mindset / Approach / Values)
- No long dense paragraphs
- Controlled pacing through spacing

This page should feel intentional and introspective.

---

## 3.5 Capabilities (Skills Page)

Purpose: Demonstrate structured competence.

Requirements:
- Categorized sections
- Visual hierarchy stronger than icons
- Avoid list-dump feeling
- Clear grouping logic
- Typography-driven layout

Must communicate organization and clarity.

---

## 3.6 Contact (Closing Page)

Purpose: Leave a strong final impression.

Requirements:
- Minimal structure
- Large typographic closing statement
- Clean presentation of contact methods
- Confident tone

This page should feel decisive.

---

# 4. User Experience Goals

Users should feel:

- Curiosity
- Respect for discipline
- Perceived competence
- Memorable visual identity
- Trust

Users should not feel:

- Overstimulated
- Confused
- Distracted
- Like they’ve seen this template before

---

# 5. Constraints

- Multi-page architecture required
- Fully responsive layout system
- Strong visual cohesion across breakpoints
- Accessibility considerations (contrast, readability)
- Clear navigation system

---

# 6. Success Metrics

The design succeeds if:

- It does not resemble common portfolio templates.
- Typography alone creates impact.
- Color system feels confident and disciplined.
- Layout choices feel intentional.
- The experience feels authored.

Failure conditions:

- Looks like a startup landing page.
- Uses safe design defaults.
- Relies on trendy gradients.
- Feels visually predictable.

---

# 7. Final Standard

The portfolio must feel like:

A designed environment.  
Not a layout.  
Not a template.  
Not an algorithmic average.

It should look like someone with taste made decisions.
